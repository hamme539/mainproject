	<!-- Lady -->
		<div class="ellen" id="woman">
			<p id="coming">For some reason I was so terrified to come out to my older brother, even though I knew he was going to be totally fine with it.<br>At 10:00pm one night, I typed an unnecessarily long message and I sent it to him.<br> I watched the screen in a silent panic as I saw the 'delivered' go to 'read at 10:02pm' and he began typing, but then he stopped.<br>

			"I heard him coming up the stairs, and he opened my door and said, 'I don't know what you were expecting me to say, but I don't care who you like.<br> You're my sister and I love you,' and I started crying. After, like, five minutes of him hugging me, he said, 'Tell me if anyone ever gives you shit for this. I will end them.' I love my brother."</p>

	<!-- Man -->
		<div class="karamo" id="man">
			<p id="out">"The first time I had applied for a job online, my dad sat with me to make sure I typed the right things and clicked the right boxes, etc. Filled out my name and age and address. And then came a question with a drop-down menu: 'sexuality'. I slowly clicked the arrow for the menu to drop down. The options were: straight, gay, bisexual, and prefer not to say. I chose the last one, and my dad says 'how come?' I make up some phoney excuse like, 'oh they think it's their right to know every little thing about me blah blah blah.' My dad just looks at me, takes the mouse, clicks the menu, chooses gay, and moves on."</p>

		<!-- Genderless -->
		<div class="oscar" id="gender">
			<p id="story">"I came out as trans* right before high school, and I was also kind of a hot mess, and pretty well known as a freak. People didn't really know what I was and instead of asking, people just made things up or thought of me as weird/gross/to be avoided, and certainly not someone you would date.

			"Junior year I got really fed up with it all, and since I liked a guy, I asked him out for a change. We were dating for a couple weeks before the question of gender came up, and then I realized â€“ he hadn't been sure of my gender or sex the whole time, but was dating me anyway, liking me as a person. Explaining my identity to him was the easiest and least threatening time I've ever come out, and today he and I have been married for over a year."</p>
